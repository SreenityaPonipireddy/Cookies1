# How to make Snickerdoodle Cookies: 
## Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
## In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar for 4-5 minutes until light and fluffy. Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the eggs and vanilla extract. Cream for 1-2 minutes longer. 
## Stir in flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt until combined.
## In a smaller bowl, stir the cinnamon and sugar. (Cinnamon sugar mixture)
## If there is time, wrap the dough and refrigerate for 20-30 minutes. Roll into small balls until round and smooth. Then, drop the balls one at a time in the cinnamon sugar mixture and coat well. (Optional: Flatten the balls with a spoon for flatter cookies)
## Place parchment paper and bake for 9-11 minutes. Let cool and ENJOY!
